The makefile must be run from the project root directory!

To compile:
make

TO RUN:
sentence splitter:
	java -cp opennlp-tools-1.9.1.jar:. SentenceDetection articles.txt > splitted.txt

token generator:
	java Scanner < splitted.txt > tokenized.txt

POS tagger:
	java -cp opennlp-tools-1.9.1.jar:. POSTagging tokenized.txt > tagged.txt

stats generator:
	java -cp opennlp-tools-1.9.1.jar:. Stats tokenized.txt > stats.txt


articles.txt contains the full list of articles provided.
With promission from Dr. Song I have used and modified the example code for this assignment.

Test Plan:
Since the 4 programs are independent and require a text file as input,
the 4 programs can be tested separately.

Since sample test files were provided we can compare the output of the first 3 programs
with the expected output in the samples of the sample.txt document file.

So, the output of the sntence splitter should match samples.splitted,
the output of the token generator should match samples.tokenized
and tha output of the POS tagger should match the samples.tagged file

For the stats generator program, the various counting and statistics requirements
can be varified by hand.
